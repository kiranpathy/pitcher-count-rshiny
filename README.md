# pitcher-count-rshiny
Similar to the hitter count project, this project utilizes R Shiny to be able to view by-count and by-pitch data for pitchers, which also includes heatmaps to identify pitcher trends in pitches thrown during selected counts and across selected pitches. Further, this includes plots and data tables that organize batter whiffs and chases for the selected counts and pitch types, which helps understand specific by-count and by-pitch successes and areas for improvement. Given the data, this RShiny app also can cover various dates of games, from every game a pitcher appears in to just one specific one, and any amount and combination in between. This can be valuable to understand pitcher approaches by-count and by-pitch as well as understanding success of pitches in certain counts and situations (success as in ability to miss bats and generate chases). Of note, this app does not have associated data provided, though it can be adapted to fit other publically-available baseball data sets.
